    "# Wind Turbine Maintenance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following problem: seven wind turbines must undergo maintenance once per week. The maintenance company has two maintenance teams available (which are identical in every respect): Team 1 and Team 2. The teams work only on weekdays, i.e., from Monday to Friday, and each team requires a full day to perform maintenance on a single wind turbine. Maintenance costs are the same for both teams, but they vary depending on the location of each turbine and on the day of the week. The costs are reported in the following table:\n",

    "## Proposed solution\n",
    "Before implementing the optimization model in PuLP, it is useful to describe clearly the mathematical structure of the problem we want to solve. The scenario is the following: we have 7 wind turbines, each of which must receive exactly one maintenance operation during the week, and we have two identical maintenance teams available. Each maintenance activity takes a full day, and the maintenance costs vary depending on both the turbine and the day of the week, mainly due to geographical and weather-related factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A suggested integer programming formulation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing the model in PuLP, a suggested integer programming formulation used to represent the maintenance scheduling problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider three index sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{T} := \\{i \\mid i \\in \\{ 1, \\ldots, 7 \\} \\}$: the set of wind turbines,\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{D} := \\{j \\mid j \\in \\{ \\text{Mon}, \\dots, \\text{Fri} \\}$: the set of different days,\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{K} := \\{k \\mid k \\in \\{ 1, 2 \\} \\}$: the set of two maintenance teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintenance cost of servicing turbine $i$ on day $j$ is denoted by $c_{ij}$.\n",
    "Since both teams are identical in cost, the index $k$ does not appear in the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{i,j,k} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if maintenance team } k \\in \\mathcal{K} \\text{ maintain wind turbine } i \\in \\mathcal{T} \\text{ at day } j \\in \\mathcal{D}, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}  \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These binary variables encode all possible assignments of turbines to days and teams.\n",

    "The goal is to minimize the total maintenance cost for the entire week:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} c_{ij} x_{ijk} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though $c_{ij}$ does not depend on $k$, the summation includes all teams because the decision variables are indexed over $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints of the model are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{cases}  \\displaystyle{ \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}}} x_{ijk} = 1 & i \\in \\mathcal{T} \\\\ \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{D}}} x_{ijk} \\leq 1 & k \\in \\mathcal{K}, j \\in \\mathcal{D}, \\\\ x_{ijk} \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\} & i \\in \\mathcal{T}, j \\in \\mathcal{D}, k \\in \\mathcal{K} \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "CBC improves efficiency by:\n",
    "- adding cutting planes, which tighten the LP relaxation and move it closer to the integer feasible region. This removes many fractional solutions before branching and reduces the size of the search tree;\n",
    "- using heuristics that quickly build “good” integer solutions, improving the upper bound early.\n",

    "- **Infeasible**: no feasible solution satisfies all constraints\n",
